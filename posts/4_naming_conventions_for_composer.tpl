Just so that I can reference it in future, here is a Composer naming convention for libraries I publish.

<!-- end_preview -->

Intahwebz/*
===========

My own projects that are meant to be reusable by other people. e.g. PHPToJavascript

Danack/*
========
Forks of other people software, e.g. My branch of Guzzle that hopefully will be merged back into main soon.

BaseReality
===========

My own projects that aren\'t meant to be used by other people. e.g. this website.
