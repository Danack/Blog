So. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was just over a year ago.

I've been thinking about writing a blog post to document my current thoughts on it, for posterity, but really have little to say.

About the only thing I can say with any confidence is the amount of solid information being published about the state of the war has been drastically reduced over the past six months. This means there are many aspects of the war that I have questions about, including some things that appear to make no sense to me, probably due to a lack of information.

In no particular order, the things that are unclear are:

* The supply situation in Crimea and southern mainland Ukraine. The rail part of the Kherch bridge is still out of action, and it's not clear whether trains are running in the southern part of mainland Ukraine. My guess is the train part of the bridge is knackered beyond Russia's ability to repair, as the steel boxes that the train bridge is constructed of, would have a huge amount of energy from the explosion on the road bridge. That would have pushed the whole of the bridge sideways, cracking multiple concrete pylons that the steel boxes sit on.

* How many Russians were actually mobilised? Putin claimed they reached the target of 300,000 people, however there were quite a few videos of mobilised troops having to live in derelict barracks with no beds. It seems possible that the Russian military stopped mobilising when they realised they had no more space for troops.

* Are the estimates of Russian casualties too high or too low? There were many reports of untrained mobilised Russian troops being dumped by the hundred on the front line without food or being able to communicate with nearby troops. It seems likely there have been quite a few Russian deaths from friendly-fire, exposure and the general unhealthiness of war.

* How bad are the Ukrainian casualties? I fear they are a lot higher than is generally known.

* Are the Russians running out of ammo? Not only did they use huge amounts during the early stages of the war, there have been many many long range strikes on ammo depots. The strikes have targeted both medium sized depots near the front-line, and very large ammo storage facilities far in the Russian rear. Just yesterday [Igor Girkin](https://twitter.com/francis_scarr/status/1629433899326603264) claimed Russia needs Chinese ammo to avoid running short.

* How bad is the Russian influence on US politics and right-wing base for people in the US to not treat a Russia led by a tyrant to be an existential threat?

* Will Ukraine be able to recapture Crimea before the fighting ends? Assuming the Armed Forces of Ukraine are able to push to the coast, then I guess they would be able to interdict any use of the Kherch bridge. An isolated island with close to 2 million civilians on it would not be able to be supplied, an no matter how fiercely the Russians fought, without supply they would be overwhelmed. Being able to capture Crimea would probably make another Russian invasion less likely.

The whole war is an a catastrophe for both Ukraine and Russia. Though I suspect Ukraine is going to recover from the war a lot faster than Russia will.
