## Why code of conducts fail

(This is part of a series of posts that I'm writing at the same time. There will be overlap between them, and I may need to refactor them to make more sense.)




Most code of conducts try to be reasonably explicit about what behaviour is or isn't allowed.

I believe this approach is fundamentally mistaken.


There are two different levels for advice about 'etiquette'.

One level is "these things are unacceptable, and you will be kicked out for saying them"
The other level is "these things will make it less likely that people will want to interact with you in the future."

People don't have to take these, but then other people might choose to not interact with that person.

My F-I-L is a high risk person... and it is my racist MAGA M-I-L that will eventually get him sick...  She still believes this is not the big deal the fake media makes it sound like.  The fake media is over-blowing this to make Trump look bad.  She has all of the Fox News talking points to describe it. My wife is constantly reminding her that people have died... and more will, but it just seems to fall in deaf ears.

I told my wife that if her mom does not change, we will be going to two funerals soon.
