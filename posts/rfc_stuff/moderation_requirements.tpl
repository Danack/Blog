## How doing an RFC makes you feel?

(This is part of a series of posts that I'm writing at the same time. There will be overlap between them, and I may need to refactor them to make more sense.)

Moderation is a vital part of keeping a community healthy.

Ideally, moderation should be done as lightly as possible. One of the mistakes communities make is allowing themselves to become toxic before bringing in moderation tools. That means a large number of people will have been driven from the community before then, and a pattern of 'non-productive' conversations will have been established. See for example /r/php.


# Lightweight

Needs to be inline with the tool the people who are moderators are using to read the messages.

If it takes effort to do the moderation it just won't be done.

# Be able to score both positively and negative, in both small and large amounts

If someone posts a slighty insightful comment, that should be promoted slightly.

If someone posts an off-topic comment, that should be downgraded slightly.

If someone posts a highly insightful and useful comment, that should be promoted

# Be open to community scoring

Trusted moderators can't be online all the time. Having people in the community

Also the whole 'moderators' can't decide what is and isn't a useful/acceptble conversation.

# Moderation needs to be able to revoke messages

i.e. remove them from where they are held, so that they can't be seen, otherwise abusive messages will still be seen and responded to.

This is one of the deep flaws in using email for PHPinternals.

An implication of this is that notifications of new messages should be separate from the holding of those messages, and that people shouldn't be able to reply to just a notification, only to messages held on the server.

# Prevent non-productive messages from being easy to respond to

The pattern used on Reddit for hiding down-voted messages is quite good. It indicates clearly that although a comment isn't abusive enough to be removed completely, anyone who continues that conversation is taking part in something the rest of the community doesn't find useful.


# Mods need to be able to keep notes on patterns of behaviour

Some actions are acceptable in small doses become unacceptable when done repeatedly e.g. help vampiring.

Moderators need to be able to keep notes that record these patterns of behaviour, so that eventually when someone gets fed up enough to do something, they can justify a moderation action, rather than it appearing to be an overreaction. e.g. https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/11?m=49230973#49230973


# Escalating set of ban-hammers

People just don't seem to accept moderation feedback. Even when someone is telling them they are breaking the rules that are in place for a community, they will continue to break those rules until they have a consequence.

Being able to kick people for 1 minute initially gives a good feedback mechanism that quickly separate people who can accept the moderation, from those who are assholes

Additionally, the notification of moderation events as per stackexchange is correct, but should be less disruptive than it is there.
