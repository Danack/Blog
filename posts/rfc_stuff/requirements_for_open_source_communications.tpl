## Requirements for communications for PHP RFCs

(This is part of a series of posts that I'm writing at the same time. There will be overlap between them, and I may need to refactor them to make more sense.)

Feedback wanted - what is this missing?


## Able to support multiple communication modes

Communication in software projects has different needs for passing different types of messages.

Sometimes you just want to drop someone a note "hey there's a typo in the word 'speel'". Other times, writing a document that is multiple thousand words long to explain a particular aspect of a project is the correct thing to do.

Sometimes you want to pass a message and have the other people on the project see it straight away. Other times, you want to make a note about something, and then leave it for weeks/months/years until someone has time to deal with it.


### Chat messages

A significant amount of technical discussion is easier to do in a 'chat format' rather than a longer format.

People don't expect messages in chat rooms to be written formally, which saves a lot of typing, and reponses can also be very terse.

> John: [link google doc] -  RFC text. Comments are world-accessible.
> Me: "Requires a 2/3 + 1 majority." - just 2/3 since, wiki.php.net/rfc/abolish-narrow-margins
> John: Roger.

Communication via chat messages takes much less emotional energy than longer form messages.


### Long format position piece

Aka making a case for one side of a discussion.


### Raising issues

People need to be able to raise 'issues' to be tracked. The most obvious case for this is bug reports, but issues also need to be tracked for things like RFCs.

* Easy to open.
* Status can be updated by 'project owners'.
* Other people can find and contribute to the discussion.


## Conversation bookmarker

Allows you to turn casual conversations into things that could be read/discovered by other people


## Linkable

Being able to link to where a conversation is taking place is a very useful thing to do.

## Collectible / Discoverable

Dividing the communication into channels for people who want to do the work, but still allows other people to opt-in easily.

## Moderation / code of conduct



## Mute-able

Everyone in a group needs to be able to mute/ignore messages from other people. That includes replies to those people.

There probably needs to be an exception for

Except room-owners

## Suspensions
