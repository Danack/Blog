> When the show writer's priority is to push The Message,

I think you, and many other people, have mistaken effect for cause.

I'm a software developer and one thing I notice in meetings is some people ask "why don't we just...?" and then propose a solution that they haven't thought through very well. I hate that pattern because good proposals normally come either from:

* a clever person having some deep insight.
* a careful and systemic analysis of the options.

Picking a random idea from the air, and then asking people to instantly point out the downsides or otherwise the group accepts that random idea, is a great way of getting shitty decisions passed.

One of the common problems in Disney (and other production companies) content is that they needed to make a lot of shows, set in a particular universe with quite strict restrictions on how characters in those shows can be changed, as "the timeline" aka Canon needs to be preserved.

So writers are hired, and told to write an episodic show, with just no good idea at the core, just "these are the characters, these are the worlds.....so anyone got any ideas?".

And so lots of just "not good" ideas get used.

I think that's because of the problem above, and also the people working on some shows just aren't quite good enough to write interesting characters.

One really good example is the difference between 'Hobie Brown' from Across the Spiderverse and the use of the AI recreations of Superman from the Flash.

[The AI recreations are deeply insulting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3CMalEu0Hg&ab_channel=Nerdstalgic), but
[Hobie Brown is an insanely well written character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ90GIuawAo&t=657s&ab_channel=schnee) that makes the story _waaaay_ more interesting:

You've got one team of writers who just asked "Hey why don't we re-use images of Superman", and the other team (or possibly single person) who said "we're going to have a character with multiple layers, and when he talks you really need to think about what he is saying, and if you do you'll understand and appreciate the message at the core of this film".

One of them deserves awards, the other is just producing pablum that even fans of that material don't particularly like.

## Meta level

I find it hilarious that the basic problem that Disney, that they are trapped by canon into making terrible content, appears to be the storyline of Across the Spiderverse.

And I think I love how I think the story is going, though I suspect I, and many others, will be angry at some parts of the how the story resolves.

There are two earlier pieces of media that I can see reflected in Across the Spiderverse:

* The Zenith comics by 2000AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_\(comics\)). Spoiler alert, people who think they saving a multiverse have actually been tricked into doing it harm, and the 'leader' isn't actually a good guy.

* The novel ['Transition' by Iain Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_\(novel\)), where the organisation that is setup to monitor the multiverse is, maybe, not such a force for good. And parts of the story are a metaphor for capitalism.  Spoiler alert, people who think they saving a multiverse have actually been tricked into doing it harm, and the 'leader' isn't actually a good guy.
