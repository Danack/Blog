# Conversations at different scales behave differently

Conversations in smaller groups are usually far more pleasant.

Conversations in large group seem to be non-productive due to fractal divergence. This is a natural result of a large group of people having divergent values.




The scale of the conversation is part of the problem.

People like the feeling of winning.

Winning an argument using actual logic or listening to the other side works when the group having the discussion is small. But when the group having the discussion is large, taking time to make specific arguments is going to be ineffective.

The only tactic that is effective is WMDs of just shitting on other techs from a great height.

Isn't that going to be an inherent problem in discussions in large groups, and that not having discussions at that scale is the only appropriate choices.




# Different values lead to different solutions

"You haven't convinced me, and so you should shut up".

When we have multiple places to hold conversations, it's much easier for people who have similar values to congregate in groups that generally have the same values.



# Response times leading to different modes of conversation

Tradeoff between personalising conversations, and having conversations that are clear for other people to follow.



# So what can we do about this?


## Setup channels for people to work in, so that other people can discover those efforts and help out.

## Keep PHP internals mailing list as the only thing people have to watch if they want to be aware of things that are going to vote.

## Maybe announce side-project efforts on internals, if people want other people to help.


## Explicitly say that "you haven't convinced me, so shut up" is an accepted practice for internals. We have the voting for RFC to avoid this.





## Other notes


What I'm seeing in the smaller conversations:


* less trying to 'win' conversations.

* More 'good will' given on both sides.



# Some work is much more difficult when the communication group is large.

The "Request for comments" part of an RFC only applies once it has actually been published. While it is in draft, and the author is still working on it, it's usually trivially easy to shit on the RFC and point out all the problems with it, which is hugely discouraging to RFC authors.

Incidentally, this is one of the few things that is actually toxic about the PHP internals process currently. Imagine someone drafted an RFC that certain other people didn't like, and the initial RFC author wanted to use php internals to discuss that potential RFC. Anytime the people who were in favour of the RFC tried to discuss how to overcome the problems with the RFC, then the usual suspects would be replying to those messages, being very negative each time.
The way that there
