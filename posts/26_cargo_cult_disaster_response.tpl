Cargo cult disaster response



Holding press conferences where serious looking people say serious things; but not doing the work of figuring out what the serious things need to be


Announcing that dramatic improvements have been made; without doing the work to actually improve the situation.


Making predictions about what is going to happen, without actually talking to someone who models this shit for a living.


Interviewing people as if they are experts on the subject matter, without checking who they are. or without having a justifiable reason for getting their opinion.


Not co-ordinating for supplies for political reasons.

Frankly, whenever the media reports on the number of new detected cases *without* context on how many tests were conducted, it creates disincentives for governments to do more testing since doing fewer tests may make things look superficially better (see also: China).
