I commented to a friend that I cook food at home most days, with 'recipes' that are quick and easy to prepare, cook and cleanup afterwards.

These are notes on them rather than full recipes.

## Eggs as either Omelette or Frittata

Fry 3 fillings chosen from say bacon, onion, mushroom, tomato, broccoli. Crack three eggs into a bowl and add a tiny splash of mil. When the things are finished frying:

* omelette, take them out of the pan, add more butter, add the eggs, put the stuff back into the eggs, distrbuted evenly across the surface. When the egg is firm add cheese to one half of the surface, and fold the omelette over.

* Frittata, add eggs to the pan. Stir it around to mix the fillings evenly in the egg. Add cheese to all of surface, place under grill broiler to finish.

## Soup

You chop vegetables up. You put them in a pan with water or stock. You boil them. You eat the soup. I like garlic in most of my soups. Again, Adam Ragusea has a good video on [vegetable soup]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ofoREnXbM).

### Spicy veg

Add lots of ginger and cilantro/coriander stalks. Save coriander leaves to add just before finishing.

### Hearty vegetables

Add mostly root vegetables e.g. parsnip, carrots, sweet potato. Cook them to well done, and use a stick blender to (carefully) puree them inside the pan. Serve with a good dollop of cream.

### Chicken soup

Onion, potato, leaks, sweet potato. Add chicken legs on bone, or just chicken thighs on bone. When the vegetables are nearly cooked, take the chicken out, let it cool for a few minutes, then remove meat from bone using your hands, and chop into small pieces, before returning meat to the pan. Vegetables can be blended before putting meat back.

## Spaghetti with sauteed stuff

Start cooking some spaghetti. Start frying some stuff. When the spaghetti is done, add it to the fried stuff, and add some cheese. Combos of fried stuff that are nice:

* bacon, red onion or leak, mushrooms, feta cheese.
* garlic, fresh chopped tomatoes, Philadelphia cream cheese.


## Bolognese sauce

Chop up some onion. Grate a couple of carrots with a box grater. Start frying some minced beef (it needs fat, don't use lean mince) in a large pan. If you like, add some minced pork, or lamb. Break up all the meat as it cooks into tiny pieces.

Optionally, when it's browned, add quite a bit of white wine. Add the onion and carrots, and about the same amount of canned chopped tomato as the meat.

Simmer on low for at least 3 hours. Add some herbs + spices at some point, I typically add bayleaf, a tiny amount of little chilli power, mace, and lots of black pepper. Add Worcester sauce about half way through, and some miso paste near the end.

## Cheesy bacony spaghetti sauce

Chop up and brown (but don't crisp) some smoked bacon. Add a lot of finely chopped onion, and medium chopped celery and soften. Add a lot of garlic, then add chopped tomato. Simmer for 30 minutes. Add a couple of teaspoons of light brown (or white) sugar, to balance the tomatoes.

Turn heat off (or at least very low) and add a lot of chopped cheddar cheese, either medium, or mix of mild and mature. Stir every minute, until the cheese melts and the sauce becomes rich and gooey.

## Sauteed chicken

Chop some deboned chicken thigh into one inch pieces. Optionally marinate with Worcester sauce, soy sauce for an hour.

Heat a pan to quite hot, to brown the chicken on both sides quite quickly. Optionally, add some spices e.g. chinese five spice, sumac, ground white pepper. Add medium chopped onion to the pan, and a few table spoons of water, and cover with a lid, turn the pan down to medium. Cook for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Adding the water steams the onions which cooks them far faster than frying. Remove the pan lid and turn heat back to high, to drive off the water. Sometimes I add cherry tomatoes and fry them just until they get a little soft. Serve with rice.

## Tomato rice

Boil some rice with cumin, add some sweetcorn right before it's done. While that's cooking fry some roughly chopped onions, add quite a bit of garlic, then add canned tomatoes. Add some tumeric, and black pepper. While that's cooking grill/broil some chunky white fish or fish-fingers. Chop up the fish. Add it and the rice to the onion + tomatoes. Mix it all up. Serve with parmesan cheese.
