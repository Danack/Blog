# Behaviour of cats due to co-evolution with humans

A lot of words have been written about the behaviour of cats and how living with humans for ten thousand words has affected that behaviour.

I have two 'pet' theories that seem kind of obvious to me, but I haven't seen elsewhere


## Behaviours selecting for likeability

Humans today generally divide animals into two groups; animals we will eat if we think they're tasty, and those we think it's wrong to eat.

It seems reasonable to me that this strong differential between those two types of animals would have been smaller in the past.

Modern farming has provided humans with a food supply that is both more bountiful, and more reliable than the food supply over the past 10,000 years.

Before our food supply was reliable, there would regularly be periods of hunger and famine. During these periods humans would get very very hungry, and things that they wouldn't normally eat would suddenly start looking quite tasty.
