I commented to a friend that I cook food at home most days, with 'recipes' that are quick and easy to prepare, cook and cleanup afterwards. These are some notes on how things I consider when deciding on what to eat.

Every meal should contain some vegetable. Even if it's just a fresh tomato cut up.

Don't eat 'reduced fat' stuff. If you're want to eat less fat, eat less stuff that contains fat.

Salt goes in liquid foods e.g. soups, sauces. Salt goes _on_ more solid food, e.g. scrambled eggs, omelette.

Sea salt is delicious. But you should buy a grinder to distribute it onto food.

Not every meal needs to contain meat. Not every meal needs to contain a carbohydrate. Sausages with a large salad is an awesome meal.

Salad needs a lot of salt. And a balsamic vinegar + oil dressing.

Dry cured bacon is the only type of bacon worth buying.

Topping food with a small amount parmesan cheese is tastier, and healthier than topping with cheddar cheese.

Using spices to make your food tasty, is much healthier than dousing them with sauce.

If your food needs a little something, but you're not such what, you either need to add more garlic or salt. Or maybe a splash of lemon juice.

Cooking and freezing soups, bolognese and curries are a great way to have tasty food for very cost. And having food ready to pull from a freezer, is awesome for days when you don't feel like cooking.

Cooked rice and pasta can be frozen at home.

Butter is the best thing to fry most meat in.

Butter is the best thing to saute most vegetables in. Particularly carrots and broccoli.

Spices are great, but you have to experiment to find what you like. My vital list of spices are:

* sea salt
* black pepper
* whole cumin/jeera I buy this in 500g bags, and throw a whole handful in with rice as it's boiling.
* Worcester sauce.
* chinese five spice.
* ginger powder.
* sumac.
* Lemon juice.
