Well, the Ukrainian "counter offensive" has begun, and while I had hoped to see the Ukrainians rapidly liberate their lands from the invaders, they are making slow-ish progress actually pushing the Russians back.

Instead of continuing to make fast attacks, which previously resulted in many vehicles being lost, the Ukrainians now appear to be methodically pushing the Russian positions and using high accuracy artillery to inflict continual large numbers of casualties on the Russians.

Given the recent [Wagner Group rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group_rebellion) showed that Russia doesn't appear to have (m)any reserves formations in Russia itself, this is probably the correct strategy for winning the war.
