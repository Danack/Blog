Let me put it like this. There are two different levels for advice about 'etiquette'. There are improvements that aim to increase the likelihood that person will want to interact with you in the future. People don't have to take these, but then other people might choose to not interact with that person. I was suggesting quite strongly, that using violent imagery in a conversation is something I personally don't like, and that I'm less likely to interact with someone that does that.




My F-I-L is a high risk person... and it is my racist MAGA M-I-L that will eventually get him sick...  She still believes this is not the big deal the fake media makes it sound like.  The fake media is over-blowing this to make Trump look bad.  She has all of the Fox News talking points to describe it. My wife is constantly reminding her that people have died... and more will, but it just seems to fall in deaf ears.

I told my wife that if her mom does not change, we will be going to two funerals soon.
