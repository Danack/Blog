Let me put it like this. There are two different levels for advice about 'etiquette'. There are improvements that aim to increase the likelihood that person will want to interact with you in the future. People don't have to take these, but then other people might choose to not interact with that person. I was suggesting quite strongly, that using violent imagery in a conversation is something I personally don't like, and that I'm less likely to interact with someone that does that.
